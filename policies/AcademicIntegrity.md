### Academic Integrity:

**Cheating:** Students will take online quizzes in Hebrew 1 and 2. These are on the "honor system." Quizzes or exams may be timed to discourage cheating, or may have to be taken in a "full screen mode" or other security-based mode. Any report that a student has cheated, or assisted another student in cheating, will be reported immediately to the administration for investigation.

The professor expects that each student will familiarize herself with the institution's expectations regarding plagiarism and academic integrity. These are found in the Academic Handbook. The guidelines regarding plagiarism are also found here:

In the context of the requirements of this course, 11-541 "Elementary Hebrew 1," students are encouraged to ask the professor any questions they may have about understanding and avoiding plagiarism.

*Do not assume that you already know what plagiarism is.* You are responsible for understanding the institution's expectations regarding plagiarism.
