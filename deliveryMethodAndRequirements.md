##Delivery Method and Requirements:

### Technical requirements:

1. Students must have regular, reliable access to a broad-band (high-speed) internet connection (e.g., DSL or cable; experience shows that modem dial-up will not prove sufficient). The course includes regular deadlines that must be accomplished with online activity.

2. Students must have access to a reasonably up-to-date computer and operating system, sufficient to run an up-to-date web browser. Computers must play sound. The G-ETS library has a limited number of laptop computers available for check-out. The Northwestern University Library has a computer center as well.

3. Students must plan to use a recent version of a major Web browser (e.g., Firefox 3 or later; Safari 3; Google Chrome 4 or later; Opera 9 or later; MS Internet Explorer 7 or later). Note especially that MS Internet Explorer 6, still common on older machines, is NOT supported.

4. Students will be strongly encouraged to use the Anki electronic flashcard system. Information about installing and using Anki [on the Mac][rlankimac] or [on Windows][rlankiwin] is available on the instructor's YouTube channel.

5. This course uses pre-recorded lectures in *.mov format. Mac users can play them on QuickTime or iTunes. Many Windows users find that they play fine on Windows player, but you may prefer to download Apple QuickTime for Windows ([http://support.apple.com/kb/DL837][rlqt]) or iTunes for Windows ([http://www.apple.com/itunes/download][rlit]/).

### Learning methods:

We begin with oral exercises, becoming familiar with the sounds and basic structures of the Hebrew language. We will work through the grammar throughout the middle of the year, roughly the latter 2/3 of the Fall term and the initial 2/3 of the Spring term. In the last weeks of the Spring term, we will take our Reading Examination and complete work on our exegesis papers. 

*I agree* to provide a variety of exercises and resources and to stay abreast of your progress. *You agree* to work *at least 6â€“8 hours each week outside of class in focused, undistracted work* on the course (I recommend **daily blocks**). *We both agree* that our goal is to complete the course of introductory grammar, because experience shows that students not exposed to all of the grammar find themselves at a severe disadvantage to use any of it in exegesis. **Experience and studies show that successful translators are those that read fluently, and that reading fluency depends on communicating daily in the target language.** If your goals for the course are more limited ("exposure" to or "appreciation" of the language; an ability to handle the aleph-bet and navigate dictionaries), then you should strongly consider not taking this course.
