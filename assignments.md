## Assignments:

Learning a language is a fluid process, but also tightly structured. There is an "all or nothing" aspect to language learning, calling for a decision to throw oneself fearlessly into the process. There is also a cumulative aspect: one cannot "skip a piece" along the way (as one might decide to "skip Bultmann week" in another class with the hope of making it up before exams). Everything always depends on what has come before, and if a student "skips a week" in her homework and practice, she will almost certainly fail in everything that follows. Let's all agree to throw ourselves in, and stay in.

Assignments include:

1. Examinations: there will be four (4) exams during Elementary Hebrew 1. (The Spring course will have three exams, plus the exegetical paper.) Each exam "weighs" equally, but there is also obviously a cumulative aspect to the exams.
2. Vocabulary Quizzes: Quizzes will be drawn from a "frequency list" of Biblical Hebrew words, beginning with the most common words and progressing through less common words.
3. Homework: Early homework will include working with the "Aleph Bet" movies, the "Thousand Pictures" exercises, and the movies in the "Foundation for Biblical Hebrew" series. Homework may include Hebrew phone calls between students or between student and instructor. Once we begin in Seow, his grammar will be the focus of our homework: in class, we will read aloud and translate from his exercises, while continuing our oral/aural activities.
